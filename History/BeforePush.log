Choose Navigation Style; Created Add Event Page

Modified:
1	navigation.php
2	index.php
3	navigation.php : newPageLink($href, $label, $attributes='')
4	readme.txt
5	/css/core.css

Reasons:
1	Finally figured out how I want the navigation to work out, will be
	using a panel that disappears on smaller screens, but is shown
	on larger screens.
2	Updated to compensate for new navigation style
3	Added the ability to specify additional attributes to the html
4	Added the url to the Nanocon github repository.
5	The Side margins on the title were a little to wide, so I shortened
	them up a bit.

Created:
1	events.php

Reasons:
1	This file will hold all functions related to events.  For now it 
	will simply house the event form.

Notes:
1	There will be 2 user classes, admins and npc's.
2	The navigation is being inserted after the footer. May change that
	at a later date.
