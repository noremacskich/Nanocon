Created VIP Page, added images.

Created:
1	vip.php
2	vip.php : newvip()
3	imgs
4	imgs/vip
5	imgs/vip/1.jpg
6	imgs/vip/2.jpg
7	imgs/vip/3.jpg
8	imgs/vip/4.png

Reasons:
1	This will hold all information regarding our guest speakers.
2	This will create a new VIP tile
3	This is where all the images go
4	This is where all VIP portriats go
5-8	Since I have to play around with pictures, why not use my cats from home?

Modified:
1	core.css
2	DocumentationStyle.txt
3	navigation.php

Reasons:
1	To give the vip page styling.
2	Updated the function style, now includes how to handle formatted strings,
	more specifically the F (format) and E (example) tags
3	Added the VIP page to the list.  It replace "Option2"

Notes:
	I should have disabled the history refactorings for this project. 
	Need to find a way to reduce image size based on connection type.
