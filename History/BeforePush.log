Modified:
1	events.php : newText($id, $Label, $attributes='')
2	events.php

Reason:

	float on top if the screen is small, or float to the side when it is 
	bigger.
2	Updated all of the function descriptions


Created:
1	events.php : newDropDown($id, $Label, $DropdownList)
2	events.php : newTextArea($id, $Label, $innerText='')

Reasons:

	it with an array containing the value and label for each option.
2	This will create a text box with multiple lines.
